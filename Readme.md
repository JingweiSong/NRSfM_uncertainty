The provided code is for the review of the paper 'A closed-form uncertainty propagation in non-rigid structure from motion'.

     

## Usage ##
A. Validation of uncertainty with Monte Carlo tests. Table (2-4) in the paper.      
1. Run Main_preprocess.m   to do Monte Carlo tests. The larger the number of iteration, the more accuracy of Monte Carlo tests.      
2. Run Main_postprocess.m to do validate the accuracy.     
3. Run Main_postprocess_video.m to visualize the uncertainity ellipsoid.   

B. Subtrajectory processing and joining.    
1. Run Main_NRSfM_sub.m to test the accuracy of sub trajectory.
